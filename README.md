# Computer Science Books 📚💻

**Computer Science Books** is a cataloging tool for computer science enthusiasts, students, and professionals. This project allows users to manage a collection of computer science books across various topics, including programming, algorithms, data structures, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Books**: Easily add new computer science books with details like title, author, category (e.g., programming, algorithms), and publication year.
- **Search and Filter**: Find books by title, author, or category, or apply filters to view books based on topics or difficulty level.
- **Organize by Topic**: Group books by categories such as Programming, Data Science, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and more.
- **Track Reading Status**: Mark books as "To Read," "Reading," or "Completed" to keep track of your reading progress.

## 📦 Installation

To set up the Computer Science Books project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-3tef/Books.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
